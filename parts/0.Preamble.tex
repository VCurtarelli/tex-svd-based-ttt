\maketitle

\begin{abstract}	
	In this paper, we propose a new singular-value decomposition -based approach for the inverse map estimation in travel-time tomography, for sound speed field reconstruction in 2D environments. This novel procedure allows exploiting the forward map's null-space for the regularization step (instead of the traditional additive term), ensuring the achievement of a primary metric's minimum, while controlling its behavior via the regularizing process. A standard method for the literature technique is also given, and a brief comparison of both is presented. Through simulations emulating oceanic bodies, the results show that our method more precisely models the speed field while achieving smaller errors.
