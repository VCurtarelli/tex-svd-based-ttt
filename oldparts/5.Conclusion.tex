In this paper, we introduced a joint estimation framework for the Noise Covariance Matrix (NCM) and Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) based on a broadband cost function. The proposed method enhances a previous NCM model by incorporating a novel DoA estimator, enabling a more direct and efficient estimation pipeline; as well as improving the formerly used general NCM estimation.

Through detailed derivations and simulations, we showed that the method achieves accurate DoA estimates with lower computational cost, especially for wider angle scenarios where conventional approaches, such as MUSIC, often degrade.

We further applied the estimated parameters in beamforming, where the proposed model enabled superior interference suppression and desired signal preservation. Among all tested beamformers, the LCMV variant leveraging our proposed NCM and DoA estimates consistently delivered the best overall performance across key signal enhancement metrics.

Future work may focus on extending the model to multi-source environments and improving the optimization process for identifying the global cost function minimum, potentially enhancing robustness and convergence speed in dynamic scenarios. Another possible extension venue is to analyze the proposed methods' performance for different array configurations, along with distinct scenarios.
