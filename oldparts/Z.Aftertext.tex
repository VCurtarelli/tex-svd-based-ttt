\section*{Biography Section}
%If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed), extra braces are
%needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
%the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
%$\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command within an optional argument. (You can create
%your own custom macro containing the $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command to make things
%simpler here.)

%{\bf If you include a photo:}\vspace{-33pt}
%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{figures/fig1}}]{Michael Shell}
%	Use $\backslash${\tt{begin\{IEEEbiography\}}} and then for the 1st argument use $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} to declare and link the author photo.
%	Use the author name as the 3rd argument followed by the biography text.
%\end{IEEEbiography}

%{\bf If you will not include a photo:}\vspace{-33pt}
%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
%	Use $\backslash${\tt{begin\{IEEEbiographynophoto\}}} and the author name as the argument followed by the biography text.
