  abstract = {Geiger's method of locating local earthquakes has been extended to include the effect of P velocity variation along the ray paths in three dimensions. The crustal structure was modeled by rectangular blocks, and a parameter was assigned to each block describing the perturbation of P wave slowness in the block. On the basis of an initial {$\bullet$}model, a set of linear equations for the observed first P arrival times was formulated in terms of the source and medium parameters. The source parameters for all the earthquakes in the data set and medium parameters for all the blocks penetrated by the seismic rays were then determined simultaneously by the damped least squares method. A computer program has been written for the case of a homogeneous initial medium model with constant P velocity. It has been tested with artificial data and applied to a set of local earthquakes recorded by a dense seismic array in Bear Valley, California. The resultant velocity distribution in the top 5 km shows a narrow low-velocity zone of about 5km/s in the San Andreas fault zone sandwiched between high-velocity regions of about 6 km/s.},

Because it is a minor modification of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path through a discrete graph, FMM is also easy to implement. In this paper we describe a new class of Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) PDEs with axis-aligned anisotropy which satisfy a causality condition for standard finite-difference schemes on orthogonal grids and can hence be solved using the FMM; the only modification required to the algorithm is in the local update equation for a node. This class of HJ PDEs has applications in anelliptic wave propagation and robotic path planning, and brief examples are included. Since our class of HJ PDEs and grids permit asymmetries, we also examine some methods of improving the efficiency of the local update that do not require symmetric grids and PDEs. Finally, we include explicit update formulas for variations of the Eikonal equation that use the Manhattan, Euclidean, and infinity norms on orthogonal grids of arbitrary dimension and with variable node spacing.},

In this note, we present a tutorial review of the theory of the Moore--Penrose pseudoinverse. We present the first definitions and some motivations, and after obtaining some basic results, we center our discussion on the spectral theorem and present an algorithmically simple expression for the computation of the Moore--Penrose pseudoinverse of a given matrix. We do not claim originality of the results. We rather intend to present a complete and self-contained tutorial review, useful for those more devoted to applications, for those more theoretically oriented, and for those who already have some working knowledge of the subject.},

Afterward, it is shown that the idea of an orthogonal projection technique together with a basic stationary iterative method can be utilized to construct a new efficient and neat hybrid algorithm for solving the mentioned problem. The convergence of the offered hybrid approach is also established. Numerical examples are examined to demonstrate the feasibility of proposed algorithms and their superiority to some of existing approaches for solving ill-conditioned linear system of equations.},

The principle consists in using external constraints of the type P''(x)=0 externally to the interpolation interval. As those constraints do not have any validity regarding the Runge function behavior we call them External Fake Constraints (EFC). We demonstrate that the EFC method can be of greater accuracy than Spline interpolation. We then apply the EFC principle to a simple aerial robotics motion planning problem and demonstrate the interest for linear system optimization under kinematics constraints and present the associated results. We then open the door to directions to improve and formalize EFC method and propose other applications in aerial robotics motion planning.},

The forward modelling is done with an algorithm based on the resolution of the eikonal equation by finite differences. The inverse problem estimates the coefficients of the radial basis functions. Radial basis functions can represent velocity models with a reduced number of parameters and nodes can be positioned without prior information. The results of the experiments show that the developed inversion tool is able to retrieve the parameters of the models represented by these functions.},

Assuming only that the array is planar (but not necessarily quasilinear), we describe a method to include in an adaptive way information about the sensor locations into the array processing, in order to take into account its geometrical shape. This information can be the relative positions of the sensors given by a mechanical device included in the array. The relative sensor positions can also be estimated using a source with a known bearing, a cooperative target for example. Simulation results in a real underwater noise sample show that these two cases lead to important improvement with respect to the classical array processing, based on a linear assumption, provided that the signal-to-noise ratio of the known source is high enough (around 10 dB in our example).},

  abstract = {Hydraulic tomography is a method to identify the three-dimensional spatial distribution of hydraulic properties in the subsurface. We propose a tomographic approach providing the inversion of travel times of hydraulic or pneumatic tests conducted in a tomographic array. The inversion is based on the relation between the peak time of a recorded transient pressure curve and the diffusivity of the investigated system. The development of a transformation factor enables the inversion of further travel times besides the peak time of a transient curve. As the early travel times of the curve are mainly related to preferential flow features while the inversion based on late travel times are reflecting an integral behavior, it can be assumed that the different inversion results reflect the properties of the overall system. By comparing the different reconstructions the system interpretation therefore becomes more comprehensive and reliable. Furthermore, the similarity of the proposed hydraulic tomographic approach to seismic travel time tomography allows us to apply the inversion algorithms which are used for seismic tomography. We therefore apply the method of staggered grids, which enables to refine the grid resulting in a higher nominal resolution, to data from a set of interference tests arranged in a tomographic array. The tests were conducted in an unsaturated fractured sandstone cylinder in the laboratory. The three-dimensional reconstructions of the diffusivity distribution are found to be highly reliable and robust. In particular, the mapped fracture of the sandstone cylinder coincides with our reconstructed diffusivity distribution.},

Conventional time-delay-and-sum beamforming does not utilize energy contained in the multipath arrivals. In this paper, a generalized beamformer is presented which coherently recombines the multipaths to provide enhanced detectability of broadband transients as well as range and depth localization of the source. Modeling of the wave field at the array due to a broadband source is accomplished with a normal mode model using 1.0-Hz increments across the 1- to 100-Hz band. These results are combined to yield the impulse response from a specified source location to each of the array elements. The set of calculated impulse responses is used in the generalized beamformer to coherently recombine energy arriving along multipaths that exist from that source range and depth to the array. The location of a source is determined by examining the beamformer output at a number of candidate range/depth cells; a peak in the output gives the location of the source. Experimental data, consisting of multiple arrivals at a hydrophone array from an explosive source at mid-depth in 2800 m of water, are processed using the generalized beamformer.},

It makes use of residuals computed in extra precision, typically at twice the working precision, and existing results guarantee convergence if the matrix A has condition number safely less than the reciprocal of the unit roundoff, u. We identify a mechanism that allows iterative refinement to produce solutions with normwise relative error of order u to systems with condition numbers of order u-1 or larger, provided that the update equation is solved with a relative error sufficiently less than 1. A new rounding error analysis is given, and its implications are analyzed. Building on the analysis, we develop a GMRES (generalized minimal residual)-based iterative refinement method (GMRES-IR) that makes use of the computed LU factors as preconditioners. GMRES-IR exploits the fact that even if A is extremely ill conditioned the LU factors contain enough information that preconditioning can greatly reduce the condition number of A. Our rounding error analysis and numerical experiments show that GMRES-IR can succeed where standard refinement fails, and that it can provide accurate solutions to systems with condition numbers of order u-1 and greater. Indeed, in our experiments with such matrices---both random and from the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection---GMRES-IR yields a normwise relative error of order u in at most three steps in every case.},

The effect of pressure on the relative speeds of sound, (UP-UPH2O) -UO-UOH2O), have been fitted to an equation of the form (with a standard deviation of 0.19 msec-1) (UP-UPH2O) - (UO-UOH2O) =AS ({$^\circ$}/oo)+BS ({$^\circ$}/oo)3/2 +CS ({$^\circ$}/oo)2, where U and UH20 are the speeds of sound in seawater and pure water, respectively; superscripts P and O are used to denote applied pressure P and O (1 atm); A, B, and C are temperature- and pressure-dependent parameters; S (o/oo) is the salinity in parts per thousand.

  abstract = {Ocean acoustic tomography (OAT) was proposed in 1979 by Walter Munk and Carl Wunsch as an analogue to x-ray computed axial tomography for the oceans. The oceans are opaque to most electromagnetic radiation, but there is a strong acoustic waveguide, and sound can propagate for 10 Mm and more with distinct multiply-refracted ray paths. Transmitting broadband pulses in the ocean leads to a set of impulsive arrivals at the receiver which characterize the impulse response of the sound channel. The peaks observed at the receiver are assumed to represent the arrival of energy traveling along geometric ray paths. These paths can be distinguished by arrival time, and by arrival angle when a vertical array of receivers is available. Changes in ray arrival time can be used to infer changes in ocean structure. Ray travel time measurements have been a mainstay of long-range acoustic measurements, but the strong sensitivity of ray paths to range-dependent sound speed perturbations makes the ray sampling functions uncertain in real cases. In the ray approximation travel times are sensitive to medium changes only along the corresponding eigenrays. Ray theory is an infinitefrequency approximation, and its eikonal equation has nonlinearities not found in the acoustic wave equation. We build on recent seismology results (kernels for body wave arrivals in the earth) to characterize the kernel for converting sound speed change in the ocean to travel time changes using more complete propagation physics. Wave-theoretic finite frequency kernels may show less sensitivity to small-scale sound speed structure.},

  abstract = {Many studies have shown the strong dependence of the solution of reflection tomography (or travel time inversion) in the model discretization interval: such solutions are purely numerical artifacts. The cause lies in the formulation of the reflection tomography which turns out to be an ill-posed problem unless properly regularized. Adequate regularizations are those which make use of derivatives of the functions describing the model (velocity distributions and reflector geometries). The order of the derivatives to use depends on the space dimension (two or three dimension). Of practical interest is curvature regularization: it works both in two and three dimensions with minimum a priori knowledge on the substratum under survey. We give theoretical arguments to prove that, with such a regularization, the computed solution is unique, stable, and almost independent of model discretization, provided that it is fine enough. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical tests on a two-dimensional model with a velocity field varying both vertically and horizontally: they show the practical interest of the proposed regularization. However, mathematical stability is not sufficient, and a priori information has to be used in order to decrease the size of the set of possible solutions. As a consequence of our theoretical study of regularization techniques, only a priori information involving derivatives of the functions describing the model yields stability. In other words, except for some pathological examples, stability is obtained only if we try to determine a smooth model of the subsurface. These conclusions remain valid for three-dimensional models and for transmission tomography. As a by-product of our study, we suggest a preconditioning which makes much easier the solution of the linear systems involved in the Gauss-Newton optimization method.},

  abstract = {This paper considers simultaneous localization of multiple acoustic sources when properties of the ocean environment (water column and seabed) are poorly known. A Bayesian formulation is developed in which the environmental parameters, noise statistics, and locations and complex strengths (amplitudes and phases) of multiple sources are considered to be unknown random variables constrained by acoustic data and prior information. Two approaches are considered for estimating source parameters. Focalization maximizes the posterior probability density (PPD) over all parameters using adaptive hybrid optimization. Marginalization integrates the PPD using efficient Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods to produce joint marginal probability distributions for source ranges and depths, from which source locations are obtained. This approach also provides quantitative uncertainty analysis for all parameters, which can aid in understanding of the inverse problem and may be of practical interest (e.g., source-strength probability distributions). In both approaches, closed-form maximum-likelihood expressions for source strengths and noise variance at each frequency allow these parameters to be sampled implicitly, substantially reducing the dimensionality and difficulty of the inversion. Examples are presented of both approaches applied to single- and multi-frequency localization of multiple sources in an uncertain shallow-water environment, and a Monte Carlo performance evaluation study is carried out.},

  abstract = {Matched field processing is a generalized beamforming method that matches received array data to a dictionary of replica vectors in order to locate one or more sources. Its solution set is sparse since there are considerably fewer sources than replicas. Using compressive sensing (CS) implemented using basis pursuit, the matched field problem is reformulated as an underdetermined, convex optimization problem. CS estimates the unknown source amplitudes using the replica dictionary to best explain the data, subject to a row-sparsity constraint. This constraint selects the best matching replicas within the dictionary when using multiple observations and/or frequencies. For a single source, theory and simulations show that the performance of CS and the Bartlett processor are equivalent for any number of snapshots. Contrary to most adaptive processors, CS also can accommodate coherent sources. For a single and multiple incoherent sources, simulations indicate that CS offers modest localization performance improvement over the adaptive white noise constraint processor. SWellEx-96 experiment data results show comparable performance for both processors when localizing a weaker source in the presence of a stronger source. Moreover, CS often displays less ambiguity, demonstrating it is robust to data-replica mismatch.},

The new method is called multistencils fast marching (MSFM), which computes the solution at each grid point by solving the Eikonal equation along several stencils and then picks the solution that satisfies the upwind condition. The stencils are centered at each grid point and cover its entire nearest neighbors. In 2D space, two stencils cover 8-neighbors of the point, whereas in 3D space, six stencils cover its 26-neighbors. For those stencils that are not aligned with the natural coordinate system, the Eikonal equation is derived using directional derivatives and then solved using higher order finite difference schemes. The accuracy of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art FMM-based techniques has been demonstrated through comprehensive numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Cross-borehole seismic tomography is a powerful tool to investigate the subsurface with a very high spatial resolution. In a set of boreholes, comprehensive three-dimensional investigations at different depths can be conducted to analyse velocity anisotropy effects due to local changes within the medium. Especially in glaciological applications, the drilling of boreholes with hot water is cost-efficient and provides rapid access to the internal structure of the ice. In turn, movements of the subsurface such as the continuous flow of ice masses cause deformations of the boreholes and complicate a precise determination of the source and receiver positions along the borehole trajectories. Here, we present a three-dimensional inversion scheme that considers the deviations of the boreholes as additional model parameters next to the common velocity inversion parameters. Instead of introducing individual parameters for each source and receiver position, we describe the borehole trajectory with two orthogonal polynomials and only invert for the polynomial coefficients. This significantly reduces the number of additional model parameters and leads to much more stable inversion results. In addition, we also discuss whether the inversion of the borehole parameters can be separated from the velocity inversion, which would enhance the flexibility of our inversion scheme. In that case, updates of the borehole trajectories are only performed if this further reduces the overall error in the data sets. We apply this sequential inversion scheme to a synthetic data set and a field data set from a temperate Alpine glacier. With the sequential inversion, the number of artefacts in the velocity model decreases compared to a velocity inversion without borehole adjustments. In combination with a rough approximation of the borehole trajectories, for example, from additional a priori information, heterogeneities in the velocity model can be imaged similarly to an inversion with fully correct borehole coordinates. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and limitations of our approach in the context of an inherent seismic anisotropy of the medium and extend our algorithm to consider an elliptic velocity anisotropy. With this extended version of the algorithm, we analyse the interference between a seismic anisotropy in the medium and the borehole coordinate adjustment. Our analysis indicates that the borehole inversion interferes with seismic velocity anisotropy. The inversion can compensate for such a velocity anisotropy. Based on the modelling results, we propose considering polynomials up to degree 3. For such a borehole trajectory inversion, third-order polynomials are a good compromise between a good representation of the true borehole trajectories and minimising compensation for velocity anisotropy.},

The technique described here utilizes sound frequencies in the audio range for acoustic imaging. The temperature-dependent sound speed as well as the flow field can be estimated by measuring the travel time of a defined acoustic signal between a sound source and a receiver when the distance between them is known exactly. The properties of the flow field are reconstructed using reciprocal sound rays to separate the direction-independent Laplace sound speed from the effective sound velocity. The temperatures in the flow field are then calculated by a combined inversion of all travel-time information resulting from the Laplace sound speed using an algebraic reconstruction technique. This reconstruction technique provides a cross section of the temperature distribution throughout the investigated area or volume. The tomographic system has been generalized to allow flow phenomena and temperature fields to be investigated with adapted sampling rates. The technique and procedures are exemplified by means of a scalable (from model-sized up to large-scale outdoor tomography) commercially oriented prototype of a tomograph which can utilize the whole audio and near-audio ultrasonic range.

The scanner consists of a circular array of transmitters and receivers which encloses the object to be imaged. By solving a nonlinear system of equations, the reconstruction algorithm estimates the sound speed of the object using the set of travel-time measurements. The main difficulty in this inverse problem is to ensure the convergence and robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a gradient method to find a solution for which the corresponding travel-times are closest to the measured travel-times in the least squares sense. To this end, first the gradient of the cost function is derived using Fermat's Principle. Then, the iterative nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm solves the minimization problem. This is combined with the backtracking line search method to efficiently find the step size in each iteration. This approach is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the cost function where the convergence point depends on the initial guess. Moreover, the method has the potential to easily incorporate regularity constraints such as sparsity as a priori information on the model. The method is tested both numerically and using in vivo data obtained from a UT scanner. The results confirm the stability and robustness of our approach for breast screening applications.},

  abstract = {Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) quantifies acoustic tissue properties such as the speedof-sound (SOS). Although full-waveform inversion (FWI) is an effective method for accurate SOS reconstruction, it can be computationally challenging for large-scale problems. Deep learning-based image-to-image learned reconstruction (IILR) methods can offer computationally efficient alternatives. This study investigates the impact of the chosen input modalities on IILR methods for high-resolution SOS reconstruction in USCT. The selected modalities are traveltime tomography (TT) and reflection tomography (RT), which produce a low-resolution SOS map and a reflectivity map, respectively. These modalities have been chosen for their lower computational cost relative to FWI and their capacity to provide complementary information: TT offers a direct SOS measure, while RT reveals tissue boundary information. Systematic analyses were facilitated by employing a virtual USCT imaging system with anatomically realistic numerical breast phantoms (NBPs). Within this testbed, a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to map dual-channel (TT and RT images) to a high-resolution SOS map. Single-input CNNs were trained separately using inputs from each modality alone (TT or RT) for comparison. The accuracy of the methods was systematically assessed using normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). For tumor detection performance, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was employed. The dual-channel IILR method was also tested on clinical human breast data. Ensemble average of the NRMSE, SSIM, and PSNR evaluated on this clinical dataset was 0.2355, 0.8845, and 28.33 dB, respectively.},

Regularization is essential in machine learning for reducing overfitting and improving model generalization. The evaluation uses a document-term matrix generated from a vectorized wine review dataset, with cross-validation performed using random forest and gradient boosting regression algorithms. Using these evaluation scores, we identify the proper regularization methods for document-term matrices. All implementations are written in Python, and the source code is provided to ensure reproducibility. While L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge or Tikhonov) regularization are widely used, this paper investigates Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as an alternative approach, particularly suited for high-dimensional and noisy datasets. Three SVD-based regularization techniques are explored for document-term matrices in the context of natural language processing: low-rank approximation, feature orthogonalization, and principal component analysis. Each method is implemented and assessed based on execution time, memory consumption, and predictive performance measured by R{$^2$} scores.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method, named the dynamical Jacobianinverse free method (DJIFM), with the incorporation of a two-sided equilibrium algorithm for solving ill-conditioned systems of linear equations with extreme physical property contrasts. The DJIFM is based on the construction of a scalar homotopy function for transforming the vector function of linear or nonlinear algebraic equations into a time-dependent scalar function by introducing a fictitious time-like variable. The DJIFM demonstrated great numerical stability for solving linear or nonlinear algebraic equations, particularly for systems involving ill-conditioned Jacobian or poor initial values that cause convergence problems. With the incorporation of a newly developed two-sided equilibrium algorithm, the solution of layered problems with extreme contrasts in the physical property that are typically highly ill-conditioned can be solved. The proposed method was then adopted for the solution of several highly ill-conditioned numerical examples, including the linear Hilbert matrix, linear Vandermonde matrix, layered linear and nonlinear groundwater flow problems. The results revealed that using the DJIFM and the two-sided equilibrium algorithm can improve the convergence and increase the numerical stability for solving layered problems.},

The DOA is modeled as a random variable with prior statistics that describe its level of uncertainty. The Bayesian beamformer is the corresponding minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator, which can be viewed as a mixture of directional beamformers combined according to the posterior distribution of the DOA given the data. Under a deterministic DOA, the mean-square error (MSE) of the Bayesian beamformer becomes as low as that of the directional beamformer equipped with the DOA candidate in the prior set that is the closest to the true DOA at exponential rate, where closeness is defined in the Kullback--Leibler sense. Two efficient algorithms using a uniform linear array (ULA) are presented. The first method utilizes the efficiency of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to compute the posterior distribution on a large number of DOA candidates. The second method approximates the posterior distribution by a Gaussian distribution, which leads to a directional beamformer incorporated with a particular spreading matrix and an adjusted DOA. Numerical simulations show that the proposed beamformer outperforms other related blind or robust beamforming algorithms over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).},

  abstract = {The estimation of ocean sound speed profiles (SSPs) requires the inversion of an acoustic field using limited observations. Such inverse problems are underdetermined, and require regularization to ensure physically realistic solutions. The empirical orthonormal function (EOF) is capable of a very large compression of the data set. In this paper, the non-linear response of the sound pressure to SSP is linearized using a first order Taylor expansion, and the pressure is expanded in a sparse domain using EOFs. Since the parameters of the inverse model are sparse, compressive sensing (CS) can help solve such underdetermined problems accurately, efficiently, and with enhanced resolution. Here, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is used to estimate range-independent acoustic SSPs using the simulated acoustic field. The superior resolution of OMP is demonstrated with the SSP data from the South China Sea experiment. By shortening the duration of the training set, the temporal correlation between EOF and test sets is enhanced, and the accuracy of sound velocity inversion is improved. The SSP estimation error versus depth is calculated, and the 99\% confidence interval of error is within {\textpm}0.6 m/s. The 82\% of mean absolute error (MAE) is less than 1 m/s. It is shown that SSPs can be well estimated using OMP.},

  abstract = {Many previously published wave-equation-based methods, which attempt to automatically invert traveltime or kinematic information in seismic data or migrated gathers for smooth velocities, suffer a common and severe problem ---the inversions are involuntarily and unconsciously hijacked by amplitude information. To overcome this problem, we have developed a new wave-equation-based traveltime inversion methodology, referred to as full-traveltime (i.e., fully dependent on traveltime) inversion (FTI), to automatically estimate a kinematically accurate velocity model from seismic data. The key idea of FTI is to make the inversion fully dependent on traveltime information, and thus prevent amplitude interference during inversion. Under the assumption that velocity perturbations cause only traveltime changes, we have derived the FTI method in the data and image domains, which are applicable to transmitted arrivals and reflected waves, respectively. FTI does not require an accurate initial velocity model or low-frequency seismic data. Synthetic and field data tests demonstrate that FTI produces satisfactory inversion results, even when using constant velocity models as initials.},

The solution, which uses discrete-time unknown input observers (UIOs), reduces the joint target detection and communication complication notably by operating on the same device and performs reliably in the presence of channel blockage and interference. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using simulation results.},

Optimizing the DIP then solely consists in the fine-tuning of the singular values, while keeping the left and right singular vectors fixed. We thoroughly validate the proposed method on real-measured {\textmu}CT data of a lotus root as well as two medical datasets (LoDoPaB and Mayo).

Recently, it was reported that DMAs can be designed by solving a linear system of equations formed from the information about the nulls of the desired beampattern. This paper deals with the problem of beamforming with linear DMAs. Its major contributions are as follows. 1) By using the spatial transform, we present some theoretical analysis of both the traditional cascade and new null-constrained DMA beamforming. It is shown that the cascade and null-constrained DMAs of the same order with the same number of sensors are theoretically identical. 2) We develop a two-stage approach to the study of the robust DMA beamformer, which is based on the principle of maximizing the white noise gain (WNG). The first-stage of this approach is in the structure of the traditional non-robust DMA while the second-stage filter is optimized for improving the WNG. 3) Using the two-stage approach, we show that the robust DMA beamformer may introduce extra nulls in the beampattern at high frequencies; particularly, it introduces extra nulls if the interelement spacing is equal to half of the wavelength, where and are the number of sensors and the DMA order, respectively. 4) We develop a method that can solve the extra-null problem while maximizing the WNG in robust DMA beamforming, i.e., a robust solution with a frequency-invariant beampattern.},

The devices used were a broadband (100 Hz--6 kHz) acoustic source towed by a ship and a vertical array. Among all the acoustic paths existing in the water column, two are used: the direct one and the seabed-reflected one, the latter being composed of the reflections from the seafloor's surface as well as that from each buried layer. Due to the good time resolution of the signal and to the short range configuration, the reflected signal can be modeled as a sum of contributions coming from image sources relative to the seabed layers. The seabed geometry and the sound speed profile can then be recovered with the detection and localization of these image sources. The map of the image sources is obtained by a function that combines back-propagation of signals and knowledge of the emitted pulse. The thickness and sound-speed of each layer is finally obtained by a position analysis of the image sources. The results obtained by this data-driven algorithm on both at-sea and synthetic data are satisfactory.},

  abstract = {The advent of Multi-core processors has offered powerful processing capabilities and provided new avenues for parallel processing. As the traditional methods of computation are inherently based on single core of execution, they are not capable of taking the advantage of high computational power offered by multi core processors, even if available. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has been proven well for many image processing techniques such as image compression, quality measure and in watermarking. SVD is a highly compute intensive algorithm that applies numerous matrix operations to an image such as transpose, inverse, multiplication of high orders to form a compressed image. However accelerating the SVD routines to exploit the underlying hardware poses a significant challenge to the programmers. This paper deals with improving the speedup of SVD algorithm used in image compression technique. This is achieved by identifying the areas where data parallelism can be applied and parallel programming model OpenMp is used to run the parallel components on multiple processors. This results in faster execution of the algorithm and hence reduces the execution time when applied to image compression for large images. This paper also addresses the space overhead of storing the matrices of SVD technique, by adapting efficient sparse matrix storage format such as Compressed Row Storage (CSR). Experimental results show that the speedup achieved through OpenMp is around 1.15 and better compression ratio with sparse matrix storage format.},

  abstract = {Underwater sound propagation is very sensitive to geometric and environmental variations. The geometric variations are the motion of the source and/or receiver, while the environmental variations are due to surface motion and water column variations. In order to reduce the effects of these variations, it is necessary to understand their effects on sound propagation. In this paper, some water column variations are reported, and their effect on the underwater sound propagation is studied. These water column variations were observed during an experiment in the TrondheimFjord on 22 September 2016. Strong amplitude variations were observed in the channel impulse response during the experiment. The Doppler analysis was performed on the channel impulse response, which showed strong Doppler variations. The amplitude and Doppler variations suggested the presence of water column variations. To demonstrate the performance of the communication system, the time reversal combiner was implemented. The system performance was demonstrated by computing the mean squared error between the transmitted signal and the output of the combiner. The performance of the combiner degraded by {\textasciitilde}2.5 dB in the presence of water column variations. Due to these variations, the amplitudes of the arrivals changed rapidly, which posed a great challenge for the time reversal combiner. These amplitude variations affected the focusing of the combiner and hence induced intersymbol interference and performance degradation. This work provides an insight into the effects of water column variations on underwater sound propagation and underwater acoustic communications.},

Similarly to the adjoint-state method, the proposed method is based on the Eikonal equation, enabling simultaneous calculation of contributions from all common-source receivers to the gradient. This overcomes the inefficiency inherent in conventional travel time tomography methods, which rely on a two-point ray tracing process. By directly calculating Fr{\'e}chet derivatives, our method avoids the complex derivation processes associated with the adjoint-state method. The key to calculating the Fr{\'e}chet derivatives is to calculate a so-called ray-path term. Consequently, compared to the adjoint-state method, the proposed method can explicitly obtain the ray paths, resulting in a more concise and intuitive derivation process. Furthermore, our method retains the benefits of the adjoint-state method, such as speed, low memory usage, and robustness. This paper focuses on elucidating the principles and algorithms for calculating the raypath term based on the fast sweeping method. The algorithms could be further speeded up by using parallel computational techniques. Synthetic tests demonstrate that our proposed travel time tomographic method accurately calculates ray paths, regardless of the complexity of the model and recording geometry.},

  abstract = {Traveltime tomography, or traveltime inversion, has been one of the primary seismological tools for decades and has been used to understand the earth's properties and dynamic processes. An accurate, preferably flexible, eikonal solver to compute the traveltime field is at the heart of the inversion process. However, most conventional eikonal solvers suffer from first-order convergence errors and difficulties dealing with irregular computational grids. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been introduced to tackle these problems and have successfully addressed these challenges. Nevertheless, these approaches still suffer from slow convergence and unstable training dynamics due to the multiterm nature of the loss function. To improve this, we develop a new formulation for the isotropic eikonal equation, which imposes boundary conditions as hard constraints. We apply the theory of functional connections to the traveltime tomography problem, which allows for using a single loss term to train the PINN model. We also analyze the effect of different traveltime factorizations on the overall inversion performance. The additive factorization yields a better result than the previously used multiplicative factorization. Our framework's efficiency, stability, and flexibility in tackling various cases, such as topography-dependent and 3D models, are tested through rigorous numerical tests, thus providing an efficient and stable PINN-based traveltime tomography. Compared with existing PINN-based inversion, our framework introduces more stability during the inversion and offers significant convergence speedups.},

  abstract = {Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a process in which seismic numerical simulations are fit to observed data by changing the wave velocity model of the medium under investigation. The problem is nonlinear, and therefore optimization techniques have been used to find a reasonable solution to the problem. The main problem in fitting the data is the lack of low spatial frequencies. This deficiency often leads to a local minimum and to nonplausible solutions. In this work we explore how to obtain low-frequency information for FWI. Our approach involves augmenting FWI with travel time tomography, which has low-frequency features. By jointly inverting these two problems we enrich FWI with information that can replace low-frequency data. In addition, we use high-order regularization, in a preliminary inversion stage, to prevent high-frequency features from polluting our model in the initial stages of the reconstruction. This regularization also promotes the nondominant low-frequency modes that exist in the FWI sensitivity. By applying a joint FWI and travel time inversion we are able to obtain a smooth model than can later be used to recover a good approximation for the true model. A second contribution of this paper involves the acceleration of the main computational bottleneck in FWI---the solution of the Helmholtz equation. We show that the solution time can be reduced by solving the equation for multiple right-hand sides using block multigrid preconditioned Krylov methods.},

  abstract = {Thermodynamic properties of compressed liquids may be obtained from measurements of the speed of sound by means of thermodynamic integration subject to initial values of density and isobaric specific heat capacity along a single low-pressure isobar. In this paper, we present an analysis of the errors in the derived properties arising from perturbations in both the speed-of-sound surface and the initial values. These errors are described in first order by a pair of partial differential equations that we integrate for the example case of water with various scenarios for the errors in the sound speed and the initial values. The analysis shows that errors in either the speed of sound or the initial values of density that are rapidly oscillating functions of temperature have a disproportionately large influence on the derived properties, especially at low temperatures. In view of this, we have obtained a more accurate empirical representation of the recent experimental speed-of-sound data for water [Lin and Trusler, J. Chem. Phys. 136, (2012) 094511] and use this in a new thermodynamic integration to obtain derived properties including density, isobaric heat capacity and isobaric thermal expansivity at temperatures between (253.15 and 473.15) K at pressures up to 400 MPa. The densities obtained in this way are in very close agreement with those reported by Lin and Trusler, but the isobaric specific heat capacity and the isobaric expansivity both differ significantly in the extremes of low temperatures and high pressures.},

  abstract = {Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction and computation of basis vectors. In many applications, especially in fluid mechanics and image processing the matrices are dense, but low-rank matrices. In these cases, a truncated SVD corresponding to the most significant singular values is sufficient. In this paper, we propose a tree based merge-and-truncate algorithm to obtain an approximate truncated SVD of the matrix. Unlike previous methods, our technique is not limited to ``tall and skinny'' or ``short and fat'' matrices and it can be used for matrices of arbitrary size. The matrix is partitioned into blocks and the truncated SVDs of blocks are merged to obtain the final SVD. If the matrices are low rank, this algorithm gives significant speedup over finding the truncated SVD, even when run on a single core. The error is typically less than 3\%.},

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a challenging data-fitting procedure based on full-wavefield modeling to extract quantitative information from seismograms. High-resolution imaging at half the propagated wavelength is expected. Recent advances in high-performance computing and multifold/multicomponent wide-aperture and wide-azimuth acquisitions make 3D acoustic FWI feasible today. Key ingredients of FWI are an efficient forward-modeling engine and a local differential approach, in which the gradient and the Hessian operators are efficiently estimated. Local optimization does not, however, prevent convergence of the misfit function toward local minima because of the limited accuracy of the starting model, the lack of low frequencies, the presence of noise, and the approximate modeling of thewave-physics complexity. Different hierarchical multiscale strategies are designed to mitigate the nonlinearity and ill-posedness of FWI by incorporating progressively shorter wavelengths in the parameter space. Synthetic and real-data case studies address reconstructing various parameters, from [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] velocities to density, anisotropy, and attenuation. This review attempts to illuminate the state of the art of FWI. Crucial jumps, however, remain necessary to make it as popular as migration techniques. The challenges can be categorized as (1) building accurate starting models with automatic procedures and/or recording low frequencies, (2) defining new minimization criteria to mitigate the sensitivity of FWI to amplitude errors and increasing the robustness of FWI when multiple parameter classes are estimated, and (3) improving computational efficiency by data-compression techniques to make 3D elastic FWI feasible.},

  abstract = {In complex near-surface geologic settings, firstarrival traveltime tomography suffers from strong data noise and uneven raypath coverage. To reduce the inversion nonuniqueness, model smoothing is necessary but often without incorporating structural constraints based on seismic images. The reasons include a lack of shallow reflections, strong noise, and gradient velocity field with strong lateral variation. We propose to estimate the near-surface structural trend from the velocity solution of deformable-layer tomography (DLT), that inverts for velocity contours directly. Then the structural dips derived from the DLT solution are taken as the structural regularization in the subsequent traveltime tomographic inversion. Tests for the 2011 Symposium on the Application of Geophysics to Engineering and Environmental Problems (SAGEEP) workshop model illustrate that this DLT-guided structural regularization steers the tomographic inversion toward more accurate near-surface models. The application of the DLT-guided structural regularization to field data reveals the near-surface geology of a beach area in Qingdao, China. The DLT solution could complement seismic images or other structural information in regularizing tomographic inversion.},

These approaches are quite elegant; however, they suffer from the drawback of necessitating the assignment of weights to prioritize speci c objective functions. In contrast, the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm provides an attractive alternative that does not require the conversion of any objective function or assignment of weights. Nevertheless, the set of Pareto-optimal solutions is obtainable. We introduce three CG techniques for solving VOPs by modifying their search directions. We consider modifying the search directions of the Fletcher-Reeves (FR), Conjugate Descent (CD), and Dai-Yuan (DY) CG techniques to obtain their descent property without the use of any line search, as well as to achieve good convergence properties. The sufficient descent property of these techniques are established without any line search and achieve global convergence using Wolfe line search. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the implementation and efficiency of the proposed techniques.},

  abstract = {Constraining geophysical models with observed data usually involves solving nonlinear and nonunique inverse problems. Neural mixture density networks (MDNs) provide an efficient way to estimate Bayesian posterior marginal probability density functions (pdf's) that represent the nonunique solution. However, it is difficult to infer correlations between parameters using MDNs, and in turn to draw samples from the posterior pdf. We introduce an alternative to resolve these issues: invertible neural networks (INNs). These are simultaneously trained to represent uncertain forward functions and to solve Bayesian inverse problems. In its usual form, the method does not account for uncertainty caused by data noise and becomes less effective in high dimensionality. To overcome these issues, in this study, we include data uncertainties as additional model parameters, and train the network by maximizing the likelihood of the data used for training. We apply the method to two types of imaging problems: One-dimensional surface wave dispersion inversion and two-dimensional travel time tomography, and we compare the results to those obtained using Monte Carlo and MDNs. Results show that INNs provide comparable posterior pdfs to those obtained using Monte Carlo, including correlations between parameters, and provide more accurate marginal distributions than MDNs. After training, INNs estimate posterior pdfs in seconds on a typical desktop computer. Hence they can be used to provide efficient solutions for repeated inverse problems using different data sets. Also even accounting for training time, our results show that INNs can be more efficient than Monte Carlo methods for solving inverse problems only once.},
